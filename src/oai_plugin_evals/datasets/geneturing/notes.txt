The geneturing.csv file is from the GeneTuring paper, listing the questions, gold-standard answers, and model answers for
the questions. Different models have questions phrased differently (for chat-based vs sentence-completion-based models), so we
really want just the questions and gold standard answers for a chat-based model. Attempting to use csvcut resulted in an encoding
error, chardetect reported "geneturing.csv: MacRoman with confidence 0.7292272285523436", so we first convert to utf8 proper with
iconv:

iconv -f MACROMAN -t UTF-8 geneturing.csv > geneturing_converted.csv

Then we extract the data of interest:

grep 'New Bing' geneturing_converted.csv | csvcut -c 2-4 > qa.csv                                                                            ─╯
