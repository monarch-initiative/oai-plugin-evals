However, I can provide you with some general information about this condition.\n\nGlycine N-methyltransferase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down a substance called glycine. This condition is caused by mutations in the GNMT gene, which provides instructions for making the glycine N-methyltransferase enzyme.\n\nMutations in the GNMT gene can lead to a deficiency or dysfunction of the glycine N-methyltransferase enzyme, resulting in the accumulation of glycine in the body. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and liver problems.\n\nIf you would like more specific information about the genes related to Glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency, I recommend consulting with a geneticist or a healthcare professional who specializes in genetic disorders. They will be able to provide you with more detailed information based on the latest research and genetic testing.",
