    "agent_answer": "Ablepharon-Macrostomia Syndrome (AMS) is a rare genetic disorder. The primary gene associated with this syndrome is the TWIST2 gene. Mutations in this gene are believed to cause the characteristic features of AMS. The TWIST2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development of tissues and organs during embryonic development.",
