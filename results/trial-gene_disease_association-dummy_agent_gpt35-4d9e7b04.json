    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT35",
    "agent_answer": "Sialidosis is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NEU1 gene. The NEU1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called neuraminidase 1, which is involved in the breakdown of certain molecules in the body. Mutations in the NEU1 gene result in reduced or absent activity of the neuraminidase 1 enzyme, leading to the accumulation of certain substances in cells and tissues.\n\nThe specific mutations in the NEU1 gene can vary among individuals with Sialidosis, and different mutations can result in different forms of the disorder, including the milder type I and the more severe type II. The symptoms of Sialidosis can also vary widely, but they often include developmental delay, intellectual disability, coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and problems with movement and coordination.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a simplified explanation, and there may be other genes or factors that can contribute to the development of Sialidosis. If you suspect that you or someone you know may have Sialidosis, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or a genetic counselor for a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis.",
