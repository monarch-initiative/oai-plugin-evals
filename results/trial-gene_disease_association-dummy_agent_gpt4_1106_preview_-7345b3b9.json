    "agent_answer": "EDICT syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by ectodermal dysplasia, intellectual disability, central nervous system malformation, and overgrowth. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene CUL4B, which is located on the X chromosome. CUL4B is part of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a critical role in protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair.\n\nMutations in CUL4B can lead to a variety of developmental abnormalities, as seen in EDICT syndrome. Since CUL4B is located on the X chromosome, the syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner, which means that males are typically more severely affected than females. Females may be carriers of the mutation and can pass it on to their offspring, but because they have two X chromosomes, the effects of the mutation may be less severe or not present due to the presence of a normal copy of the gene on the other X chromosome.\n\nIt's important to note that genetic disorders can be complex, and the relationship between a specific gene mutation and the resulting phenotype can vary among individuals. Genetic counseling and testing are recommended for individuals and families affected by or concerned about EDICT syndrome or other genetic conditions.",
