    "agent_answer": "Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a type of thyroid cancer that originates from the parafollicular cells (also known as C cells) of the thyroid gland. These cells produce the hormone calcitonin. Elevated levels of calcitonin in the blood can indicate MTC.\n\nSeveral genes have been associated with the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma. The most significant one is the RET (rearranged during transfection) proto-oncogene. Mutations in the RET gene are responsible for most cases of hereditary MTC, either as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndromes or familial MTC.\n\nOther genes that may be involved in MTC include:\n\n1. HRAS: A gene that makes a protein involved in regulating cell division. Mutations can cause cells to divide uncontrollably, leading to cancer.\n\n2. KRAS: This gene also makes a protein involved in cell division. Like HRAS, mutations can lead to uncontrolled cell division and cancer.\n\n3. BRAF: This gene makes a protein that helps transmit signals inside cells, which are involved in cell growth and division. Mutations can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer.\n\n4. NTRK1: This gene makes a protein involved in nerve growth, and mutations can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer.\n\n5. GDNF: This gene makes a protein that promotes the growth and survival of certain types of neurons. Mutations can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer.\n\nPlease note that while these genes are associated with MTC, not everyone with mutations in these genes will develop MTC. Other factors, such as environmental factors and other genetic changes, may also play a role in the development of this disease.",
