    "agent_answer": "Congenital disorders of deglycosylation are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the process of glycosylation, which is the attachment of sugars to proteins and lipids. This process is crucial for the proper function of many proteins and lipids within the body. When glycosylation is disrupted, it can lead to a variety of health problems.\n\nOne of the known congenital disorders of deglycosylation is Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG), which is a rapidly expanding family of genetic diseases. CDG is caused by mutations in genes that encode enzymes or transporters involved in the glycosylation pathway. There are many types of CDG, each associated with mutations in different genes. Some of the genes related to CDG include:\n\n1. PMM2 (Phosphomannomutase 2) - This gene is associated with CDG type Ia, the most common form of CDG.\n2. ALG6 (Asparagine-linked Glycosylation 6) - Mutations in this gene cause CDG type Ic.\n3. MPI (Mannose Phosphate Isomerase) - Mutations in this gene lead to CDG type Ib.\n4. ALG3 (Asparagine-linked Glycosylation 3) - This gene is associated with CDG type Id.\n5. ALG12 (Asparagine-linked Glycosylation 12) - Mutations in this gene cause CDG type Ig.\n6. PMM1 (Phosphomannomutase 1) - This gene is related to CDG type Ik.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many other genes associated with various types of CDG. Each type of CDG is classified based on the gene that is affected and the specific step in the glycosylation pathway that is disrupted.\n\nIt's important to note that the field of genetic research is constantly evolving, and new genes related to congenital disorders of deglycosylation may be discovered over time. For the most current information, consulting a geneticist or a specialist in metabolic disorders would be advisable. Additionally, genetic databases and scientific literature can provide up-to-date information on newly identified genes and their associated conditions.",
