    "goldstandard": "TBX5",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Holt-Oram syndrome is primarily related to mutations in the TBX5 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a family of proteins known as T-box proteins. These proteins play a crucial role in the development of tissues and organs during embryonic development. Mutations in the TBX5 gene disrupt the development of the heart and upper limbs, leading to the features of Holt-Oram syndrome.",
