    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for FFDD3 is not recognized in the standard nomenclature used by databases such as GenBank, the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), or other similar repositories. It's possible that \"FFDD3\" could be a term used in specific research contexts or publications, but it is not an established gene symbol in the broader scientific community.\n\nIf you are looking for information on a specific gene, it would be best to refer to it by its official gene symbol or to provide additional context or details that might help identify the gene in question. If \"FFDD3\" is a term from a particular study or a non-standard abbreviation, you may need to consult the original source for clarification on what gene it refers to.",
