    "goldstandard": "PI4KA, TTC7A",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT35",
    "agent_answer": "There are several genes that have been associated with both gastrointestinal defects and immunodeficiency syndrome. Some of these genes include:\n\n1. IL2RG: This gene is associated with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a condition characterized by a lack of functional immune cells. It has also been linked to gastrointestinal defects such as enteropathy.\n\n2. FOXP3: Mutations in the FOXP3 gene can lead to immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, which is characterized by autoimmune disorders and gastrointestinal problems.\n\n3. RAG1 and RAG2: These genes are involved in the development and function of immune cells. Mutations in these genes can cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and may also be associated with gastrointestinal defects.\n\n4. NOD2: Mutations in the NOD2 gene have been linked to Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract. Some individuals with NOD2 mutations may also have immunodeficiency.\n\n5. IL10RA and IL10RB: These genes encode receptors for the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), which plays a role in immune regulation. Mutations in these genes can lead to immunodeficiency and may also be associated with gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nIt's important to note that these genes are just a few examples, and there may be other genes that are also involved in gastrointestinal defects and immunodeficiency syndrome. Additionally, the specific impact of these gene mutations can vary among individuals, leading to a wide range of symptoms and severity.",
