    "agent_answer": "Currarino syndrome is a congenital condition characterized by a triad of anomalies: anorectal malformation, sacral bone defect, and a presacral mass. It is a rare genetic disorder that can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\nThe primary gene associated with Currarino syndrome is the MNX1 gene (previously known as HLXB9). Mutations in the MNX1 gene are responsible for the majority of cases of Currarino syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development of the spinal cord and the tissues that give rise to the lower spine and the anorectal region.\n\nIn some cases, Currarino syndrome may occur without a known mutation in the MNX1 gene, suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors may also contribute to the development of the syndrome. However, the MNX1 gene is the primary gene known to be associated with this condition.",
