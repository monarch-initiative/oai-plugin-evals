    "agent_answer": "Hyperphenylalaninemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. It is most commonly caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which is necessary for the normal metabolism of phenylalanine. The condition can range from mild to severe, with the most severe form being phenylketonuria (PKU).\n\nThe primary gene associated with hyperphenylalaninemia is the PAH gene, which provides instructions for making the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Mutations in the PAH gene can lead to various forms of hyperphenylalaninemia, including PKU. These mutations can reduce the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase or prevent the enzyme from being made at all, leading to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body.\n\nIn addition to the PAH gene, there are other genes that can influence phenylalanine metabolism and contribute to hyperphenylalaninemia, although they are less common. These include:\n\n1. GCH1: This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called GTP cyclohydrolase 1, which is involved in the production of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). BH4 is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, and its deficiency can lead to hyperphenylalaninemia.\n\n2. PTS: The PTS gene encodes the enzyme 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase, which is also involved in the synthesis of BH4. Deficiencies in this enzyme can result in hyperphenylalaninemia due to decreased levels of BH4.\n\n3. QDPR: The QDPR gene provides instructions for making the enzyme quinoid dihydropteridine reductase, which is necessary for the regeneration of BH4. Mutations in this gene can lead to a reduction in BH4 levels and hyperphenylalaninemia.\n\n4. PCBD1: This gene encodes the enzyme pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase, which is involved in the recycling of BH4. Deficiencies in this enzyme can also cause hyperphenylalaninemia.\n\n5. DNAJC12: Mutations in the DNAJC12 gene, which encodes a protein thought to be involved in the stabilization or regulation of enzymes like phenylalanine hydroxylase and others involved in BH4 metabolism, can lead to hyperphenylalaninemia.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific genetic cause of hyperphenylalaninemia can vary between individuals, and genetic testing is often used to determine the exact mutation(s) involved. Treatment and management strategies may differ depending on the underlying genetic cause and the severity of the condition.",
