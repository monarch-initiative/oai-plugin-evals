    "agent_answer": "B-cell immunodeficiency can be caused by mutations in various genes that are critical for the development, function, or survival of B cells. B cells are a type of white blood cell that play a key role in the adaptive immune response by producing antibodies to fight off infections. When there is a defect in one or more of the genes involved in B-cell function, it can lead to a range of primary immunodeficiency disorders. Some of the genes related to B-cell immunodeficiency include:\n\n1. **IGHM** - Mutations in this gene can cause agammaglobulinemia, which is characterized by an absence of immunoglobulins or antibodies in the blood.\n\n2. **BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase)** - Mutations in the BTK gene cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), which is an inherited immunodeficiency disorder affecting B-cell development.\n\n3. **CD79A and CD79B** - These genes encode components of the B-cell receptor complex, and mutations can lead to agammaglobulinemia.\n\n4. **BLNK (B-cell linker)** - Mutations in the BLNK gene can disrupt B-cell development and lead to agammaglobulinemia.\n\n5. **PIK3CD and PIK3R1** - These genes encode components of the PI3K signaling pathway, which is important for B-cell development and function. Mutations can lead to activated PI3K-delta syndrome, a disorder that affects the immune system.\n\n6. **LRBA (Lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige-like anchor protein)** - Mutations in LRBA can cause common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), which is characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins and an increased susceptibility to infections.\n\n7. **TNFRSF13B (TACI)** - Mutations in this gene can also cause CVID or can lead to selective IgA deficiency.\n\n8. **MS4A1 (CD20)** - This gene encodes the CD20 protein, which is expressed on the surface of B cells. Mutations can affect B-cell function and lead to immunodeficiency.\n\n9. **ICOS (Inducible T-cell costimulator)** - Mutations in ICOS can cause CVID by affecting T-cell help for B-cell antibody production.\n\n10. **SH2D1A (SAP)** - Mutations in SH2D1A can cause X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, which can include hypogammaglobulinemia as one of its features.\n\n11. **CD40 and CD40LG (CD40 ligand)** - Mutations in these genes can disrupt the interaction between T cells and B cells, which is necessary for B-cell activation and class switching. This can lead to hyper-IgM syndrome, characterized by high levels of IgM and low levels of other immunoglobulin isotypes.\n\nThese are just a few examples of genes associated with B-cell immunodeficiency. It's important to note that genetic mutations in these genes can lead to a spectrum of immunodeficiency disorders with varying severity and clinical manifestations. Genetic testing and counseling are often used to diagnose these conditions and to guide treatment and management strategies.",
