    "agent_answer": "Leukoencephalopathy with dystonia and motor neuropathy (LDM) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive dystonia, motor neuropathy, and white matter abnormalities in the brain. Several genes have been associated with LDM. Here are some of the genes related to Leukoencephalopathy with dystonia and motor neuropathy:\n\n1. DARS2: This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aspartyl-tRNA synthetase 2. Mutations in the DARS2 gene can cause LDM.\n\n2. GJC2: This gene encodes a protein called connexin 47, which is involved in the formation of gap junctions in the brain. Mutations in the GJC2 gene can lead to LDM.\n\n3. HARS2: This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called histidyl-tRNA synthetase 2. Mutations in the HARS2 gene have been associated with LDM.\n\n4. KARS: This gene encodes a protein called lysyl-tRNA synthetase. Mutations in the KARS gene can cause LDM.\n\n5. RARS2: This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called arginyl-tRNA synthetase 2. Mutations in the RARS2 gene have been linked to LDM.\n\nIt's important to note that LDM is a complex disorder, and the presence of a mutation in one of these genes does not guarantee the development of the condition. Genetic testing and consultation with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor are necessary for a definitive diagnosis.",
