    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for \"HsT1192\" is not a standard nomenclature for human genes. Human gene symbols are typically standardized by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), and they usually consist of a combination of letters and sometimes numbers that represent a specific gene.\n\nThe term \"HsT1192\" appears to be an older or non-standard designation for a gene or a sequence that might have been used in past research literature or databases. To find the current official gene symbol, you would need to cross-reference \"HsT1192\" with updated databases such as GenBank, the HGNC database, or other genomic resources.\n\nIf you have access to a specific sequence or additional context for \"HsT1192,\" you could use that information to search in a genomic database to find the current official gene symbol. If you provide more details, I can attempt to assist you further in identifying the gene.",
