    "agent_answer": "Otofaciocervical syndrome (OFCS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by various anomalies including facial dysmorphism, preauricular tags, hearing impairment, and shoulder girdle anomalies. The syndrome has been associated with mutations in specific genes. As of my last update, the following genes have been implicated in the development of Otofaciocervical syndrome:\n\n1. **EYA1 (EYA Transcriptional Coactivator And Phosphatase 1)**: Mutations in the EYA1 gene have been associated with OFCS type 1. This gene plays a crucial role in the development of the ear, eyes, and other structures.\n\n2. **PAX1 (Paired Box 1)**: Mutations in the PAX1 gene have been linked to OFCS type 2. PAX1 is important for the development of the cervical vertebrae and other tissues.\n\n3. **PAX3 (Paired Box 3)**: Although PAX3 is not typically associated with OFCS, mutations in this gene can cause conditions with overlapping features, such as Waardenburg syndrome, which can include hearing loss and changes in pigmentation.\n\nIt's important to note that genetic research is an ever-evolving field, and new genes associated with various syndromes, including OFCS, may be discovered over time. For the most current information, consulting a geneticist or a specialist in genetic disorders would be advisable, as they can provide the latest insights into the genetic basis of Otofaciocervical syndrome.",
