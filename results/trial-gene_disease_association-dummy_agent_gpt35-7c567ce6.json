    "agent_answer": "Trichoepithelioma is a benign skin tumor that arises from the hair follicles. It is associated with several genes that play a role in hair follicle development and function. Some of the genes related to Trichoepithelioma include:\n\n1. CYLD Gene: Mutations in the CYLD gene are associated with familial cylindromatosis, a condition characterized by the development of multiple skin tumors, including trichoepitheliomas.\n\n2. PTCH1 Gene: Mutations in the PTCH1 gene are associated with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin syndrome. Trichoepitheliomas can occur in individuals with NBCCS.\n\n3. APC Gene: Mutations in the APC gene are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a condition characterized by the development of multiple polyps in the colon and rectum. Trichoepitheliomas can occur in individuals with FAP.\n\n4. CTNNB1 Gene: Mutations in the CTNNB1 gene have been found in some cases of trichoepithelioma. The CTNNB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-catenin, which is involved in cell adhesion and signaling pathways.\n\nIt is important to note that not all cases of trichoepithelioma are associated with these specific gene mutations. The genetic basis of trichoepithelioma is complex, and additional genes and genetic factors may also be involved. Genetic testing and consultation with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor can provide more specific information about the genetic factors related to an individual's trichoepithelioma.",
