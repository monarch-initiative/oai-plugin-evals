    "agent_answer": "There are several genes that have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders with nonspecific brain abnormalities and with or without seizures. Some of these genes include:\n\n1. ARX (Aristaless Related Homeobox): Mutations in the ARX gene have been linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, including X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG), Partington syndrome, and West syndrome.\n\n2. CDKL5 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase-Like 5): Mutations in the CDKL5 gene are associated with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder called CDKL5 deficiency disorder. This disorder is characterized by early-onset seizures, intellectual disability, and developmental regression.\n\n3. STXBP1 (Syntaxin Binding Protein 1): Mutations in the STXBP1 gene have been found in individuals with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, which is characterized by seizures and developmental delay.\n\n4. SCN1A (Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 1): Mutations in the SCN1A gene are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including Dravet syndrome, which is characterized by seizures, cognitive impairment, and behavioral problems.\n\n5. MECP2 (Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2): Mutations in the MECP2 gene are responsible for Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females. Rett syndrome is characterized by loss of purposeful hand skills, seizures, and intellectual disability.\n\nIt's important to note that these genes are just a few examples, and there are likely many other genes that can contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders with nonspecific brain abnormalities and seizures. Additionally, the presence of a mutation in one of these genes does not guarantee the development of a neurodevelopmental disorder, as other genetic and environmental factors can also play a role.",
