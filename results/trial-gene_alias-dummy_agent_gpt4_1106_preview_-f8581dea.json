    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for C6orf186 is \"MROH8.\" This gene is located on chromosome 6 in humans and is part of a region designated as an open reading frame (orf), hence the \"orf\" in its previous name. The gene symbol \"MROH8\" stands for \"Maestro Heat-Like Repeat Family Member 8.\" The renaming of genes from orf designations to more descriptive names is part of an ongoing effort to standardize gene nomenclature and make it more informative.",
