    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for SGEF is indeed \"SGEF.\" SGEF stands for \"SH3-containing GRB2-like (endophilin) interacting factor.\" It is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular signaling pathways and may play a role in cytoskeletal organization. The gene symbol is designated by official databases such as the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), which is responsible for approving unique symbols and names for human genes.",
