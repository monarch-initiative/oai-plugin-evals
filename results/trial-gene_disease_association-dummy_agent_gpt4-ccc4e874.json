    "goldstandard": "FLNB",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome is a rare genetic disorder. It is primarily associated with mutations in the FLNB gene (Filamin B). This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. Mutations in the FLNB gene disrupt the normal development of bones and other tissues during embryonic growth, leading to the features of Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome.",
