    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Hemolytic anemia due to phosphofructokinase deficiency is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the PFKM gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphofructokinase, which is important for breaking down (metabolizing) sugars in the body for energy. Mutations in the PFKM gene reduce the activity of phosphofructokinase, preventing cells, particularly muscle cells, from metabolizing sugar efficiently. This leads to the symptoms associated with the disorder.",
