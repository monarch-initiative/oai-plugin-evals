    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for C11orf27 is \"HMBS\". This gene is located on chromosome 11 and encodes the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase, which is involved in the synthesis of heme, an essential component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various other cytochromes. Mutations in the HMBS gene can lead to a rare genetic disorder known as acute intermittent porphyria.",
