    "agent_answer": "Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a type of thyroid cancer that originates from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland, which produce the hormone calcitonin. MTC can be sporadic or hereditary, and the hereditary form is often associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndromes.\n\nThe most important gene related to hereditary MTC is the RET proto-oncogene. Mutations in the RET gene are responsible for the majority of hereditary cases of MTC, and they are also found in some sporadic cases. The RET gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is involved in signaling within cells, particularly in the development of the kidneys and the enteric nervous system, as well as in the growth and function of certain nerve cells.\n\nThere are two main types of MEN2 syndromes associated with mutations in the RET gene:\n\n1. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A): This syndrome is characterized by the development of MTC, pheochromocytoma (a type of tumor that can affect the adrenal glands), and hyperparathyroidism. The majority of MEN2A cases are caused by mutations in the RET gene.\n\n2. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B): This syndrome is rarer than MEN2A and is also associated with MTC and pheochromocytoma, but instead of hyperparathyroidism, individuals with MEN2B may have mucosal neuromas, a marfanoid body habitus, and other developmental abnormalities. MEN2B is also caused by mutations in the RET gene, often at a specific codon (M918T).\n\nIn addition to the RET gene, other genetic factors may contribute to the risk and development of MTC, but they are less well understood and not as commonly implicated as the RET gene.\n\nFor individuals with a family history of MTC or MEN2 syndromes, genetic testing for RET mutations is recommended to assess the risk and to guide clinical management, including prophylactic thyroidectomy in some cases to prevent the development of MTC.",
