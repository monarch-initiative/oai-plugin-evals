However, FAP9 is not a recognized official gene symbol according to the standard nomenclature. It's possible that it could be a typo or a less commonly used symbol. I would recommend checking a reliable source such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) for the correct gene symbol.",
