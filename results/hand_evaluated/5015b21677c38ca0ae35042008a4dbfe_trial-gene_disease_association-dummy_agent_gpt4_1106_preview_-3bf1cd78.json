    "agent_answer": "Split-foot malformation with mesoaxial polydactyly, also known as split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM) with long bone deficiency (SHFLD), is a rare genetic condition that affects the development of the hands and feet. It is characterized by the absence of some fingers or toes, fusion of remaining digits, and sometimes the presence of extra digits (polydactyly). The condition can also involve the long bones of the arms and legs.\n\nThe genetic basis of split-foot malformation with mesoaxial polydactyly can be complex, and several genes have been associated with the condition. Some of the genes that have been implicated in SHFM include:\n\n1. **TP63** (Tumor Protein p63) - Mutations in the TP63 gene are associated with several syndromes that include limb malformations, including SHFM.\n\n2. **WNT10B** (Wnt Family Member 10B) - Variants in this gene have been linked to SHFM in some cases.\n\n3. **FBXW4** (F-Box And WD Repeat Domain Containing 4, also known as DACTYLIN) - Mutations in this gene have been identified in individuals with SHFM.\n\n4. **DLX5** and **DLX6** (Distal-Less Homeobox 5 and 6) - These genes are part of a family of homeobox genes that play a role in limb development, and mutations can lead to SHFM.\n\n5. **BHLHA9** (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Family Member A9) - This gene has been associated with SHFM with mesoaxial polydactyly in some studies.\n\nIt's important to note that SHFM can be inherited in different patterns, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked, depending on the specific gene mutation involved. Genetic testing and counseling can help to determine the specific genetic cause and inheritance pattern in affected individuals or families.\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by this condition, it is recommended to consult with a geneticist or a genetic counselor for personalized information and guidance.",
