    "agent_answer": "Hemolytic anemia due to phosphofructokinase deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the enzyme phosphofructokinase, which is involved in the breakdown of glucose in red blood cells. Mutations in the PFKM gene, which provides instructions for making the muscle isoform of phosphofructokinase, can cause this condition.\n\nHere are some genes related to Hemolytic anemia due to phosphofructokinase deficiency:\n\n1. PFKM: This gene provides instructions for making the muscle isoform of phosphofructokinase. Mutations in this gene can lead to a deficiency of phosphofructokinase, resulting in the breakdown of red blood cells and the development of hemolytic anemia.\n\nIt's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there may be other genes or genetic factors involved in this condition. Genetic testing and consultation with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor can provide more detailed information about the specific genetic factors related to an individual's condition.",
