    "agent_answer": "Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), also known as type 1 renal tubular acidosis, is a disorder of the kidney tubules that impairs the normal acidification of urine. This condition leads to a failure to acidify the urine to the normal pH levels, which results in systemic metabolic acidosis (a condition where there is too much acid in the body fluids).\n\nSeveral genes have been associated with hereditary forms of distal renal tubular acidosis. Mutations in these genes can lead to dysfunction of the renal tubules and the symptoms of dRTA. The genes commonly related to dRTA include:\n\n1. **ATP6V1B1**: This gene encodes a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which is responsible for acidifying various intracellular compartments and the urine. Mutations in ATP6V1B1 can cause dRTA often accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n2. **ATP6V0A4**: Similar to ATP6V1B1, this gene also encodes a component of the V-ATPase. Mutations in ATP6V0A4 can lead to dRTA, typically without associated hearing loss.\n\n3. **SLC4A1**: This gene encodes the anion exchanger 1 (AE1), which is involved in the exchange of chloride and bicarbonate across the cell membrane. Mutations in SLC4A1 can cause dRTA, sometimes with additional hematological abnormalities such as hereditary spherocytosis.\n\n4. **FOX1**: This gene is less commonly implicated in dRTA, but mutations here can also lead to the condition.\n\n5. **KCNJ1**: This gene encodes the potassium channel, ROMK, which is important for potassium recycling in the kidney and proper function of the V-ATPase. Mutations in KCNJ1 can result in antenatal/neonatal forms of dRTA with hyperkalemia.\n\n6. **CA2**: This gene encodes carbonic anhydrase II, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate and protons. Mutations in CA2 can cause osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIt's important to note that dRTA can also be acquired and not just genetic. Acquired dRTA can be due to autoimmune diseases, certain medications, or chronic kidney diseases, among other causes. Genetic testing and consultation with a healthcare professional can help determine if dRTA is due to a genetic mutation and which gene is affected.",
