    "agent_answer": "Brody myopathy is a rare genetic muscle disorder characterized by muscle stiffness and difficulty relaxing muscles after exercise. The condition is typically caused by mutations in the ATP2A1 gene, which encodes an enzyme called the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 1 (SERCA1). This enzyme is responsible for pumping calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a structure within muscle cells that stores calcium. When the ATP2A1 gene is mutated, the function of SERCA1 can be impaired, leading to an abnormal buildup of calcium in the muscle cells, which causes the muscle stiffness and myopathy seen in Brody disease.\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff date in April 2023, the ATP2A1 gene is the primary gene associated with Brody myopathy. However, genetic research is ongoing, and it is possible that other genes may be found to be related to the condition in the future. If you are seeking information for medical purposes, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional or a genetic counselor for the most current and personalized information.",
