    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT35",
    "agent_answer": "Spinal muscular atrophy with congenital bone fractures (SMABF) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and congenital bone fractures. The specific genes associated with SMABF are COL1A1 and COL1A2.\n\nCOL1A1 and COL1A2 are genes that provide instructions for making the alpha-1 and alpha-2 chains of type I collagen, respectively. Type I collagen is a major component of connective tissues such as bone, skin, and tendons. Mutations in these genes can disrupt the normal structure and function of type I collagen, leading to the signs and symptoms of SMABF.\n\nIt's important to note that SMABF is a complex disorder, and other genetic and environmental factors may also contribute to its development. Genetic testing and consultation with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor are recommended for a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis.",
