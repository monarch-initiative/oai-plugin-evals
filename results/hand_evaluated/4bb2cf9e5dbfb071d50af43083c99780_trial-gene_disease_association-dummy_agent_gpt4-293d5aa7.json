    "goldstandard": "GNMT",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder. It is caused by mutations in the GNMT gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glycine N-methyltransferase, which is involved in the process of methylation. Methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to other molecules, both proteins and DNA. These processes are critical for normal functioning of cells. Mutations in the GNMT gene can lead to the deficiency of the glycine N-methyltransferase enzyme, causing the disorder.",
