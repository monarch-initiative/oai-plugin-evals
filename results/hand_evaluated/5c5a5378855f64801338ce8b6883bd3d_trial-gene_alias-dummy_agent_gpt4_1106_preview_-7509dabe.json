    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for SNAT6 is SLC38A6. This gene belongs to the solute carrier family 38, member 6. The SLC38 family includes sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporters, which are responsible for the transport of amino acids across cell membranes. SNAT6, as a member of this family, is involved in the transport of certain amino acids, playing a role in amino acid homeostasis, nutrient sensing, and cellular signaling.",
