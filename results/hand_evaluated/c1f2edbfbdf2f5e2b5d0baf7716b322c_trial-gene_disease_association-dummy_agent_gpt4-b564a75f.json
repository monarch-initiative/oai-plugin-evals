    "goldstandard": "POLG",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 4A (Alpers type) is primarily related to mutations in the POLG gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in replicating and repairing the mitochondrial DNA. Mutations in this gene can lead to mitochondrial DNA depletion, which can cause a variety of medical conditions, including Alpers syndrome.",
