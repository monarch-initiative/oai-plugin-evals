    "goldstandard": "MLLT10",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for AF10 is \"KMT2A\" (lysine methyltransferase 2A). However, it's important to note that AF10 is often associated with the gene \"MLLT10\" (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to, 10), which is the gene that encodes the AF10 protein. MLLT10 is known for its involvement in chromosomal translocations resulting in leukemia, where it can fuse with other genes, including KMT2A.\n\nKMT2A, previously known as MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia), is a gene that encodes a histone methyltransferase and is also implicated in leukemogenesis through chromosomal translocations. The KMT2A gene is distinct from MLLT10 but is related in the context of leukemia as they can form fusion genes when translocated.\n\nPlease ensure to verify the context in which \"AF10\" is mentioned, as it could refer to the protein product of the MLLT10 gene or be related to the KMT2A gene in the context of chromosomal translocations in leukemia.",
