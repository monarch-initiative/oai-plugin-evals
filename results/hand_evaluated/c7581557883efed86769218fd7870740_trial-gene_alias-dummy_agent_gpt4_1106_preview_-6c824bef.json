    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for C20orf86 is \"MFSD3,\" which stands for Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain Containing 3. This gene is located on chromosome 20, and as the name suggests, it is a member of the major facilitator superfamily, which includes various transport proteins that facilitate the movement of small molecules across cell membranes. The \"orf\" in the original name C20orf86 stands for \"open reading frame,\" which is a part of the genome that has the potential to be translated into a protein. Gene symbols are often updated to reflect new information about gene function, and in this case, C20orf86 was updated to MFSD3.",
