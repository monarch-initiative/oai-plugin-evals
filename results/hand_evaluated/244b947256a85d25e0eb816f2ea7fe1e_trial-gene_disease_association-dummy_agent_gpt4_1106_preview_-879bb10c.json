    "agent_answer": "Orofaciodigital syndrome XIV, also known as OFD14, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the oral cavity, facial features, and digits. It is one of several types of orofaciodigital syndromes, each of which is caused by mutations in different genes.\n\nAs of my last update in April 2023, OFD14 is associated with mutations in the C2CD3 gene. The C2CD3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for the formation of primary cilia, which are hair-like structures that protrude from the surface of many types of cells. These cilia play a key role in the signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, movement, and differentiation during embryonic development.\n\nMutations in the C2CD3 gene disrupt the normal development of primary cilia, leading to the range of physical abnormalities seen in OFD14. This can include malformations of the face, oral cavity, and digits, as well as possible brain and kidney abnormalities.\n\nIt's important to note that genetic research is an ever-evolving field, and new discoveries about genetic conditions and their associated genes are made regularly. For the most current information, consulting a geneticist or a database of genetic disorders would be advisable.",
