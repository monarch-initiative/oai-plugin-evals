    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Sialidosis is a severe inherited disorder that affects many parts of the body. The two types of Sialidosis are both related to mutations in the NEU1 gene. This gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called neuraminidase 1, which is essential for the normal functioning of lysosomes. Mutations in the NEU1 gene disrupt the normal function or production of neuraminidase 1, preventing these enzymes from breaking down sialic acid-rich glycoproteins and glycolipids, leading to a toxic buildup in tissues and organs, which causes the signs and symptoms of Sialidosis.",
