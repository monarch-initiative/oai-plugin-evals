    "agent_answer": "Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a condition characterized by the inability of the kidneys to properly acidify urine, leading to an accumulation of acid in the blood. While there are no specific genes that have been definitively linked to dRTA, there are several genes that have been associated with the condition. These genes include:\n\n1. ATP6V1B1: Mutations in this gene have been found in individuals with autosomal recessive dRTA. The ATP6V1B1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the acidification of urine.\n\n2. ATP6V0A4: Mutations in this gene have also been associated with autosomal recessive dRTA. The ATP6V0A4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the acidification of urine.\n\n3. SLC4A1: Mutations in this gene have been found in individuals with autosomal dominant dRTA. The SLC4A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anion exchanger 1 (AE1), which is involved in the transport of bicarbonate ions in the kidneys.\n\nIt is important to note that dRTA can also be caused by acquired conditions, such as autoimmune diseases or certain medications. In these cases, the underlying cause may not be related to specific genes. Additionally, there may be other genes that are associated with dRTA that have not yet been identified.",
