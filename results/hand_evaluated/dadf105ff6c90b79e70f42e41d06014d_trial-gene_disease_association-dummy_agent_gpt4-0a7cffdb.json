    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Brody myopathy is a condition related to the ATP2A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SERCA1). This enzyme is primarily found in skeletal muscle cells, where it plays a crucial role in muscle contraction and relaxation. Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene can lead to Brody myopathy.",
