    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Siddiqi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder. It is caused by mutations in the KIAA1109 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. However, it is believed to play a crucial role in the development before and after birth. Mutations in the KIAA1109 gene disrupt the normal development of several body systems, leading to the varied signs and symptoms of Siddiqi syndrome.",
