    "agent_answer": "Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism, primarily affecting the liver. The condition is related to mutations in the GNMT gene, which is responsible for encoding the enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolism of the amino acid methionine by catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) to glycine, forming S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and sarcosine.\n\nMutations in the GNMT gene can lead to reduced or absent activity of the GNMT enzyme, resulting in an accumulation of methionine and its metabolites. This can cause various symptoms, including liver disease, neurological problems, and an increased risk of liver cancer.\n\nThe GNMT gene is located on chromosome 6 (6p12), and various mutations in this gene can cause GNMT deficiency. Genetic testing can identify these mutations and confirm a diagnosis of GNMT deficiency. However, because it is a rare condition, the specific mutations and their frequencies in the population are not as well characterized as those for more common genetic disorders.",
