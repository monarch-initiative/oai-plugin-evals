    "agent_answer": "Pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PNAD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple pigmented nodules in the adrenal glands. The exact genes related to PNAD are not well understood, but mutations in the PRKAR1A gene have been associated with a similar condition called Carney complex, which can include PNAD as one of its features.\n\nIt is important to note that PNAD can also occur as an isolated condition without any known genetic cause. Genetic testing and consultation with a medical geneticist or genetic counselor can provide more specific information about the genetic factors related to an individual's PNAD.",
