    "agent_answer": "Cone dystrophy is a group of eye disorders that affect the cone cells in the retina, which are responsible for color vision and visual acuity. Several genes have been associated with these disorders. Here are a few:\n\n1. **GUCY2D**: Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of autosomal dominant cone dystrophy. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that plays a crucial role in normal vision.\n\n2. **CRX**: This gene is involved in the development and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the retina. Mutations can lead to various forms of retinal degeneration, including cone dystrophy.\n\n3. **PITPNM3**: Mutations in this gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant cone dystrophy.\n\n4. **GUCA1A**: This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a crucial role in the recovery of photoreceptor cells after exposure to light. Mutations can cause several types of inherited retinal dystrophies, including cone dystrophy.\n\n5. **AIPL1**: Mutations in this gene can cause Leber congenital amaurosis, an early-onset retinal dystrophy, and other forms of retinal degeneration, including cone dystrophy.\n\n6. **RPGR**: This gene is most commonly associated with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, but mutations can also cause cone dystrophy.\n\n7. **CDHR1**: Mutations in this gene can cause autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy.\n\n8. **ABCA4**: This gene is most commonly associated with Stargardt disease, but mutations can also cause cone dystrophy.\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list and the genetic causes of cone dystrophy are still not fully understood. Genetic testing can help identify the specific cause in an individual.",
