    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for SEP3 is \"SEPALLATA3.\" SEP3 is a member of the MADS-box family of transcription factors and is known for its role in the development of floral organs in plants, particularly in Arabidopsis thaliana. It is one of the key genes involved in the ABC model of flower development, where it functions as part of the 'E' class genes to specify the identity of petals, stamens, and carpels, and to mediate floral meristem determinacy.",
