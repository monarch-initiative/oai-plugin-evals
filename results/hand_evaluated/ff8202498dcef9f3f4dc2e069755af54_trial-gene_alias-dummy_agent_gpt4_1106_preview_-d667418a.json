    "goldstandard": "IFT22",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for a gene is assigned by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), which is responsible for approving unique symbols and names for human genes. As of my last update, there is no widely recognized gene symbol \"FAP9\" in standard genetic databases or literature.\n\nIt's possible that \"FAP9\" could be a non-standard abbreviation or a symbol used in a specific research context that has not been officially recognized by the HGNC. If you are looking for information on a specific gene, it would be best to use the official gene symbol or the full name of the gene to search in genetic databases such as GenBank, the NCBI Gene database, or the HGNC database itself.\n\nIf \"FAP9\" refers to a specific aspect of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, which is often abbreviated as FAP, it's important to note that the condition is primarily associated with mutations in the APC gene (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli). There is no \"FAP9\" gene associated with this condition in the official nomenclature.\n\nIf you have more context or a different interpretation of \"FAP9,\" please provide additional details, and I can attempt to give a more precise answer.",
