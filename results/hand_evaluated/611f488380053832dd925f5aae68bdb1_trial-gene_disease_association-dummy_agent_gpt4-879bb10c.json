    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Orofaciodigital syndrome XIV, also known as Joubert syndrome 23, is a rare genetic disorder. It is primarily associated with the gene C2CD3. Mutations in this gene are known to cause the syndrome. The C2CD3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the structure and function of cilia, which are small, finger-like projections on the surface of cells. When this gene is mutated, it can lead to the various symptoms associated with Orofaciodigital syndrome XIV.",
