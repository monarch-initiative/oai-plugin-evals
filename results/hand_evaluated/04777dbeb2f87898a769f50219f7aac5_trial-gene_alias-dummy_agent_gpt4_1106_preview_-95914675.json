    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for PCPB is not a standard abbreviation for a known human gene. It's possible that there might be a typo or a mix-up with the acronym. However, if you are referring to the gene that encodes the enzyme Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR), then the official gene symbol is PYCR1 for the human gene. PYCR1 is involved in the biosynthesis of proline from glutamate.\n\nIf PCPB stands for something else or is related to another organism, please provide more context or check the specific nomenclature databases for the correct organism. For human genes, the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is the authority for gene symbols and names.",
