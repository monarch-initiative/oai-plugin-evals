    "agent_answer": "It appears that there are no results for the term \"MPS4B\" in the category of genes in the Monarch Initiative knowledge graph. MPS4B might not be the official gene symbol, or it may be known by a different name.\n\nMPS4B typically refers to a type of Mucopolysaccharidosis, which is a disease rather than a gene. If you are looking for the gene associated with Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB (Morquio Syndrome B), the gene you are looking for is likely GLB1, which encodes the enzyme beta-galactosidase.\n\nWould you like me to search for the disease \"Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVB\" to find the associated gene, or do you have another gene symbol in mind?",
