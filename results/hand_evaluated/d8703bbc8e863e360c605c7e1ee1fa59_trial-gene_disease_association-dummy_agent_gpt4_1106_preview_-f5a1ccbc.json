    "agent_answer": "Acrocallosal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is primarily characterized by abnormalities in the development of the brain, specifically the absence or underdevelopment of the corpus callosum, which is the structure that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. Other features of the syndrome can include craniofacial anomalies, polydactyly (extra fingers or toes), and intellectual disability.\n\nThe primary gene associated with Acrocallosal syndrome is the KIF7 gene, which is located on chromosome 15. Mutations in the KIF7 gene can disrupt the normal development of the central nervous system and other parts of the body. The KIF7 gene plays a role in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is important for the patterning and growth of many body structures during embryonic development.\n\nAnother gene that has been associated with features overlapping with Acrocallosal syndrome is the GLI3 gene. Mutations in GLI3 can cause Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), which shares some clinical features with Acrocallosal syndrome, such as polydactyly and craniofacial anomalies.\n\nIt is important to note that genetic disorders can be complex, and the presentation of symptoms can vary widely among individuals. Genetic testing and consultation with a geneticist or other healthcare professional are typically required to confirm a diagnosis of Acrocallosal syndrome or related disorders.",
