    "agent_answer": "Nephropathy due to CFHR5 deficiency, also known as CFHR5 nephropathy, is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys. It is caused by mutations in the CFHR5 gene. The CFHR5 gene encodes a protein called complement factor H-related protein 5, which is part of the complement system, a part of the immune system that helps clear pathogens from an organism.\n\nMutations in the CFHR5 gene can lead to abnormal function or structure of the CFHR5 protein, which can result in uncontrolled activation of the complement system. This uncontrolled activation can cause damage to the kidneys, leading to the development of nephropathy.\n\nCFHR5 nephropathy is characterized by proteinuria (the presence of excess proteins in the urine), hematuria (blood in the urine), and progressive loss of kidney function. It is a form of C3 glomerulopathy, which is a group of kidney diseases characterized by deposition of complement proteins in the glomeruli (the filtering units of the kidneys).\n\nThe condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is necessary to cause the disorder. Individuals with a family history of CFHR5 nephropathy may benefit from genetic counseling and testing to determine their risk of developing the disease or passing it on to their offspring.",
