    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol \"CTGLF6\" does not correspond to a recognized gene in standard human gene nomenclature. It's possible that there might be a typo or a mix-up with the intended gene symbol. Gene symbols are standardized by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) to ensure consistency in the naming of human genes.\n\nIf you are looking for information on a specific gene, please provide the correct gene symbol or additional context, such as the gene's function or its associated traits or diseases, and I can attempt to assist you further. If \"CTGLF6\" is a gene from a non-human organism or a newly discovered gene that has not yet been officially named, additional information would be needed to identify it.",
