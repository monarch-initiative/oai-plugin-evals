    "agent_answer": "Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of connective tissue abnormalities and the development of multiple subcutaneous nodules. The exact genes related to Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome are not well understood. However, mutations in the LEMD3 gene have been identified in some individuals with this condition. The LEMD3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called LEM domain-containing protein 3, which is involved in the regulation of bone formation and the development of connective tissues. Mutations in the LEMD3 gene can disrupt the normal function of this protein, leading to the signs and symptoms of Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome. It is important to note that not all individuals with Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome have mutations in the LEMD3 gene, suggesting that other genes or genetic factors may also be involved in the development of this condition.",
