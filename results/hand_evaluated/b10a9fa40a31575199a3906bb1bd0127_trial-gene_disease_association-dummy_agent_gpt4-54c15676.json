    "agent_answer": "Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (dRTA) is a medical condition that affects the kidney's ability to properly filter and balance the pH of the body's fluids. It is often associated with genetic mutations. Here are some genes that have been linked to dRTA:\n\n1. **ATP6V1B1**: This gene provides instructions for making one piece of a large enzyme complex that is responsible for acidifying certain compartments within cells. Mutations in this gene can cause type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis.\n\n2. **ATP6V0A4**: This gene also provides instructions for making a part of the same enzyme complex as ATP6V1B1. Mutations in this gene can also cause type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis.\n\n3. **SLC4A1**: This gene provides instructions for making a protein that transports certain ions across cell membranes. Mutations in this gene can cause a form of distal renal tubular acidosis that is often associated with a blood disorder called hereditary spherocytosis.\n\n4. **FOXI1**: This gene is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of several genes involved in the development and function of the inner ear and kidney. Mutations in this gene have been associated with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor for more detailed information and to understand how this might relate to an individual's specific medical condition.",
