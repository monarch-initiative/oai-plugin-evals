    "agent_answer": "Achromatopsia, also known as rod monochromacy or total color blindness, is a rare, inherited eye condition that affects the cone cells in the retina, which are responsible for color vision. Individuals with achromatopsia have difficulty or are unable to perceive colors and usually have additional visual problems, such as sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and poor visual acuity.\n\nSeveral genes have been associated with achromatopsia, and mutations in these genes can lead to the condition. The most commonly implicated genes include:\n\n1. **CNGA3 (Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Channel Alpha 3)**: Mutations in this gene are one of the most common causes of achromatopsia. The CNGA3 gene provides instructions for making one part of a protein that forms ion channels in the cone cells. These channels are essential for the normal function of cone cells in response to light.\n\n2. **CNGB3 (Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Channel Beta 3)**: Like CNGA3, the CNGB3 gene is also frequently associated with achromatopsia. It encodes another part of the ion channel in cone cells. Mutations in CNGB3 can disrupt the function of these channels, leading to the symptoms of achromatopsia.\n\n3. **GNAT2 (G Protein Subunit Alpha Transducin 2)**: The GNAT2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the phototransduction pathway, which is the process by which light is converted into electrical signals in the retina. Mutations in GNAT2 can impair color vision by affecting cone cell function.\n\n4. **PDE6C (Phosphodiesterase 6C)**: This gene encodes a protein that is part of the phototransduction cascade in cone cells. Mutations in PDE6C can lead to a disruption in the normal visual cycle and cause achromatopsia.\n\n5. **PDE6H (Phosphodiesterase 6H)**: The PDE6H gene provides instructions for making the inhibitory subunit of the cone photoreceptor phosphodiesterase. Mutations in this gene can also result in achromatopsia by affecting the phototransduction pathway in cones.\n\n6. **ATF6 (Activating Transcription Factor 6)**: Although less common, mutations in the ATF6 gene have been identified in some individuals with achromatopsia. This gene is involved in the cellular stress response and is believed to play a role in the development and function of the retina.\n\nAchromatopsia is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to be affected by the condition. Genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific gene mutations involved.",
