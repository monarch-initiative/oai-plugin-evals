    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for a gene referred to as M12.219 is not universally recognized or standardized across different organisms or databases without additional context. Gene symbols are typically assigned by standard nomenclature committees for different species, such as the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for human genes, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) for mouse genes, and others for different organisms.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, more information is needed about the species in which M12.219 is found and the context in which this designation is used. If M12.219 is a designation from a specific research study, database, or nomenclature system, please provide that context so that I can attempt to find the corresponding official gene symbol.",
