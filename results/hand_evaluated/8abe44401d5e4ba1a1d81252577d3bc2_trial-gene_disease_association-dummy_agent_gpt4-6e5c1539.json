    "agent_answer": "I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to provide real-time medical or genetic information. However, I can tell you that CFHR5 is a gene that has been associated with a condition known as CFHR5 nephropathy, which is a type of kidney disease. Mutations in this gene can lead to the development of the disease. For more detailed and accurate information, please consult a medical professional or a geneticist.",
