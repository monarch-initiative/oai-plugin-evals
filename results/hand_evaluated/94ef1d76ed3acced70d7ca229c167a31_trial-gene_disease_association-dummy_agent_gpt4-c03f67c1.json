    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "As an AI, I can provide information based on available data. Several genes have been associated with cerebrovascular malformations that can lead to intracranial hemorrhage. These include:\n\n1. KRIT1 (CCM1): Mutations in this gene are associated with cerebral cavernous malformations, a condition that can cause brain hemorrhages.\n\n2. CCM2: This gene is also associated with cerebral cavernous malformations.\n\n3. PDCD10 (CCM3): Mutations in this gene can cause cerebral cavernous malformations as well.\n\n4. ENG and ACVRL1: These genes are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, a condition that can cause arteriovenous malformations and hemorrhages in the brain.\n\n5. SMAD4: This gene is associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, both of which can lead to brain hemorrhages.\n\n6. RASA1: Mutations in this gene can cause capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation, a condition that can lead to brain hemorrhages.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor for more detailed information and personalized advice.",
