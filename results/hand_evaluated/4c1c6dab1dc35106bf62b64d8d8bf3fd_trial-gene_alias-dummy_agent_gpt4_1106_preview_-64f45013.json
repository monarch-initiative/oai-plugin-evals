    "question": "What is the official gene symbol of CXorf40B?",
    "goldstandard": "EOLA2",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for CXorf40B is \"ENSG00000284747\". However, it's important to note that gene symbols are typically short, unique abbreviations used to easily identify genes. In this case, \"CXorf40B\" stands for \"Chromosome X Open Reading Frame 40B,\" indicating that this gene is located on the X chromosome and is the 40th open reading frame identified in a particular region.\n\nThe identifier \"ENSG00000284747\" is actually an Ensembl gene ID, which is a stable identifier used by the Ensembl Genome Browser to uniquely identify a gene within their database. Ensembl is a widely used resource for genome information, and their IDs provide a way to access detailed information about genes, including their function, structure, and related biological data.\n\nIf you are looking for the gene symbol to use in literature or databases, \"CXorf40B\" would be the correct term to refer to this gene. If you need to look up detailed information about the gene in the Ensembl database, you would use the Ensembl gene ID \"ENSG00000284747\".",
