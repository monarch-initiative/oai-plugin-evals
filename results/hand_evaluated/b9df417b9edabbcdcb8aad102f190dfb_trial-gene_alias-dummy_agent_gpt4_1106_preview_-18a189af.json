    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for RSG1 is \"RRAGD.\" RRAGD stands for Ras-related GTP binding D, and it is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including growth, cytoskeletal organization, and intracellular trafficking. The RRAGD gene plays a role in amino acid-induced mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) activation, which is important for cell growth and metabolism.",
