    "agent_answer": "Cone dystrophy is a group of inherited eye disorders that primarily affect the cone cells in the retina, leading to vision loss and color vision abnormalities. Several genes have been associated with cone dystrophy. Some of the genes related to cone dystrophy include:\n\n1. ABCA4: Mutations in the ABCA4 gene are associated with Stargardt disease, which is a form of cone dystrophy that affects children and young adults.\n\n2. CNGB3: Mutations in the CNGB3 gene are associated with achromatopsia, a severe form of cone dystrophy characterized by complete color blindness and reduced visual acuity.\n\n3. CNGA3: Mutations in the CNGA3 gene are also associated with achromatopsia.\n\n4. GNAT2: Mutations in the GNAT2 gene can cause cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response, a condition characterized by reduced visual acuity and abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) responses.\n\n5. PDE6C: Mutations in the PDE6C gene are associated with cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response as well.\n\n6. PDE6H: Mutations in the PDE6H gene can cause cone dystrophy with or without rod involvement.\n\n7. PROM1: Mutations in the PROM1 gene are associated with autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy, which affects both cone and rod cells in the retina.\n\nIt's important to note that cone dystrophy can be caused by mutations in various genes, and the specific genes involved can vary among individuals. Genetic testing and consultation with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor are recommended for a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis.",
