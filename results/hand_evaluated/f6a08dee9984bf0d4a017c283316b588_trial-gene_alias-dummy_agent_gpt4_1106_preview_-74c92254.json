    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol of a gene is designated by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), which is responsible for approving unique symbols and names for human genes. However, \"CT116\" does not appear to be a standard gene symbol recognized by the HGNC.\n\nIt's possible that \"CT116\" could be an alias, an outdated symbol, or a term used in a specific research context rather than an official gene symbol. To provide accurate information, I would need more context or the correct and full name of the gene in question.\n\nIf you have additional information or a different name that might be associated with \"CT116,\" please provide it, and I can attempt to find the official gene symbol for you.",
