    "agent_answer": "Siddiqi syndrome, also known as Zaki syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinct facial features, and other physical abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in the gene USB1 (also known as C16orf57), which is located on chromosome 16. The USB1 gene is involved in the processing of ribosomal and spliceosomal RNA, which are crucial for protein synthesis and gene expression regulation.\n\nMutations in the USB1 gene lead to a range of symptoms that can include developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly (small head size), and distinctive facial features. Because Siddiqi syndrome is so rare, the full spectrum of associated symptoms and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.\n\nIf you are looking for information on genetic disorders, it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional or a genetic counselor who can provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.",
