    "goldstandard": "NUP50",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for NPAP60L is \"NUP210L.\" This gene encodes a protein known as \"Nucleoporin 210kDa Like,\" which is a component of the nuclear pore complex. The nuclear pore complex is responsible for the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. The gene symbol \"NPAP60L\" might be an outdated or alternative name for the gene, but \"NUP210L\" is the standard nomenclature used in genetic databases such as NCBI's Gene database and the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC).",
