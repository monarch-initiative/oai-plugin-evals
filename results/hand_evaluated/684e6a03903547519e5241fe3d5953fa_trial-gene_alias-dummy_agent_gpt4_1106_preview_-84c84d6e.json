    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for AGTIL is not a standard nomenclature recognized in human genetics. It's possible that there might be a typo or a mix-up with the gene name. However, if you are referring to a gene related to the angiotensinogen (AGT) system, the official gene symbol for angiotensinogen is \"AGT.\"\n\nIf AGTIL is a specific gene of interest in a non-human organism or a less commonly studied gene, it would be helpful to have more context or the full name of the gene to provide an accurate answer. If you can provide additional details or clarify the organism in question, I can attempt to give you more specific information.",
