    "agent_answer": "Haim-Munk syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by a constellation of clinical features, including palmoplantar keratoderma, severe periodontitis, arachnodactyly, acroosteolysis, atrophic changes of the nails, and radiographic abnormalities of the fingers.\n\nThe gene related to Haim-Munk syndrome is the cathepsin C gene (CTSC). Mutations in the CTSC gene are responsible for the symptoms observed in Haim-Munk syndrome. The CTSC gene encodes for the cathepsin C protein, which is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the activation of various serine proteases in immune and inflammatory cells. Deficiency in this enzyme activity due to mutations leads to the clinical manifestations of the syndrome.\n\nHaim-Munk syndrome shares many clinical features with Papillon-Lef\u00e8vre syndrome (PLS), which is also caused by mutations in the CTSC gene. Both conditions are sometimes considered allelic disorders due to their genetic and phenotypic similarities. However, Haim-Munk syndrome has distinct features, such as arachnodactyly and acroosteolysis, which are not typically seen in Papillon-Lef\u00e8vre syndrome.",
