    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for Morquio syndrome type B (MPS IVB) is \"GLB1.\" This gene encodes the enzyme beta-galactosidase, which is involved in the lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans. Mutations in the GLB1 gene can lead to a deficiency in beta-galactosidase activity, resulting in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the body and causing the symptoms associated with Morquio syndrome type B.",
