    "agent_answer": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects multiple systems in the body, including the nervous system. The exact cause of MSA is unknown, but there are several genes that have been associated with an increased risk of developing the condition. These genes include:\n\n1. SNCA: The SNCA gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-synuclein. Mutations in this gene have been found in some individuals with MSA. These mutations are thought to lead to the accumulation of abnormal alpha-synuclein protein in the brain, which is a hallmark feature of MSA.\n\n2. COQ2: Mutations in the COQ2 gene have been identified in a small number of individuals with MSA. The COQ2 gene is involved in the production of coenzyme Q10, which is important for energy production in cells. It is believed that mutations in this gene may disrupt the normal functioning of mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, leading to the development of MSA.\n\n3. MAPT: The MAPT gene provides instructions for making a protein called tau. Mutations in this gene have been associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including MSA. These mutations are thought to disrupt the normal structure and function of tau protein, leading to the formation of abnormal protein aggregates in the brain.\n\nIt is important to note that not all individuals with MSA have mutations in these genes, and having a mutation in one of these genes does not necessarily mean that a person will develop MSA. The development of MSA is likely influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.",
