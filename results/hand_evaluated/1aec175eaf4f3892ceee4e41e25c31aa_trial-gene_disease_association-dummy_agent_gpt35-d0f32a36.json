    "goldstandard": "TCEAL1",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT35",
    "agent_answer": "There are several genes that have been found to be related to neurodevelopmental disorders with gait disturbance. Some of these genes include:\n\n1. ARX (Aristaless Related Homeobox): Mutations in the ARX gene have been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, and gait disturbance.\n\n2. MECP2 (Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2): Mutations in the MECP2 gene are primarily associated with Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects girls. Gait disturbance is one of the common symptoms of Rett syndrome.\n\n3. SLC6A1 (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 1): Mutations in the SLC6A1 gene have been linked to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, and gait disturbance.\n\n4. TUBA1A (Tubulin Alpha 1A): Mutations in the TUBA1A gene have been associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including lissencephaly (smooth brain), intellectual disability, and gait disturbance.\n\n5. STXBP1 (Syntaxin Binding Protein 1): Mutations in the STXBP1 gene have been found in individuals with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, which is often characterized by intellectual disability, movement disorders, and gait disturbance.\n\nIt's important to note that these genes are just a few examples, and there may be other genes that are also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders with gait disturbance. Additionally, the presence of a mutation in one of these genes does not guarantee the development of a neurodevelopmental disorder, as other genetic and environmental factors can also play a role.",
