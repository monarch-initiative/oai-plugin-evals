    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for DCSCRIPT is ZNF366, which stands for \"zinc finger protein 366.\" This gene encodes a protein that contains C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in DNA binding and gene regulation. ZNF366 was previously known as DC-SCRIPT (Dendritic Cell-Specific Transcript) because it was initially identified as being specifically expressed in dendritic cells. However, the standardized nomenclature for gene symbols provided by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) designates ZNF366 as the official symbol for this gene.",
