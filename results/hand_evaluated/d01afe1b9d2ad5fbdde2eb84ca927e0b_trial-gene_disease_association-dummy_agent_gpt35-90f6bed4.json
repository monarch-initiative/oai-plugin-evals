    "goldstandard": "SLC10A2, SLC51B",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT35",
    "agent_answer": "Bile acid malabsorption is a condition characterized by the impaired absorption of bile acids in the small intestine. While there is no single gene that has been identified as the sole cause of bile acid malabsorption, several genes have been found to be associated with this condition. These genes are involved in the regulation of bile acid synthesis, transport, and metabolism. Some of the genes related to bile acid malabsorption include:\n\n1. ASBT (SLC10A2): This gene encodes the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, which is responsible for the uptake of bile acids from the intestinal lumen into the enterocytes.\n\n2. OST\u03b1 (SLC51A): This gene encodes the alpha subunit of the organic solute transporter, which is involved in the efflux of bile acids from the enterocytes into the portal circulation.\n\n3. OST\u03b2 (SLC51B): This gene encodes the beta subunit of the organic solute transporter, which forms a heterodimer with OST\u03b1 and is required for its function.\n\n4. FXR (NR1H4): This gene encodes the farnesoid X receptor, a nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of genes involved in bile acid synthesis, transport, and metabolism.\n\n5. FGF19: This gene encodes fibroblast growth factor 19, which is a hormone that is released from the intestine in response to bile acid binding to FXR. FGF19 regulates bile acid synthesis and transport.\n\n6. TGR5 (GPBAR1): This gene encodes the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1, which is expressed in the intestine and other tissues and plays a role in the regulation of bile acid synthesis, transport, and metabolism.\n\nIt is important to note that bile acid malabsorption can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and the exact genetic mechanisms underlying this condition are still being studied.",
