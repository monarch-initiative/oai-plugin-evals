    "agent_answer": "Holt-Oram syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by abnormalities in the bones of the upper limbs and heart defects. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the TBX5 gene, which is located on chromosome 12. The TBX5 gene plays a crucial role in the development of the heart and upper limbs during embryonic development.\n\nMutations in the TBX5 gene can lead to a range of symptoms, from very mild to severe, and can affect the structure and function of the heart, as well as the development of the bones in the arms and hands. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that only one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\nThere is no cure for Holt-Oram syndrome, but treatment focuses on managing the symptoms, particularly the heart and limb abnormalities, and may include surgery, physical therapy, and cardiac care. Genetic counseling is also recommended for affected individuals and their families.",
