    "agent_answer": "Haim-Munk syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma (thickening of the skin on the palms and soles), severe periodontitis (inflammation and destruction of the tissues surrounding the teeth), and other features such as nail abnormalities and skeletal abnormalities. \n\nThe exact genes related to Haim-Munk syndrome have not been identified yet. However, it is believed to be caused by mutations in a gene or genes that are involved in the development and maintenance of the skin, teeth, and bones. Further research is needed to determine the specific genes involved in this syndrome.",
