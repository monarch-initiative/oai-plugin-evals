    "agent_answer": "Cleft palate with ankyloglossia is a rare congenital condition that involves a combination of a cleft palate and ankyloglossia, commonly known as tongue-tie. The genetic basis of this condition can be complex and may involve multiple genes. However, one gene that has been specifically associated with cleft palate with ankyloglossia is the TBX22 gene.\n\nThe TBX22 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development of the face, skull, and tongue. Mutations in this gene can disrupt the normal development of these structures, leading to conditions such as cleft palate and ankyloglossia. TBX22 mutations are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, which means that the condition is more common in males, who have only one X chromosome.\n\nIt's important to note that while TBX22 is a known gene associated with this condition, other genetic and environmental factors may also contribute to the development of cleft palate and ankyloglossia. Genetic testing and counseling can provide more personalized information for individuals or families affected by this condition.",
