    "agent_answer": "Achromatopsia is a rare inherited vision disorder that affects the retina, the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It is associated with several genes, including:\n\n1. CNGB3: This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for normal color vision. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of achromatopsia.\n\n2. CNGA3: This gene also provides instructions for making a protein necessary for normal color vision. Mutations in this gene are the second most common cause of achromatopsia.\n\n3. GNAT2: This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in color perception. Mutations in this gene cause a form of achromatopsia that is often less severe than the forms caused by mutations in the CNGB3 and CNGA3 genes.\n\n4. PDE6C and PDE6H: These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in transmitting visual signals from the retina to the brain. Mutations in these genes can cause achromatopsia.\n\n5. ATF6: This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in stress responses in cells. Mutations in this gene can cause achromatopsia.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor for more detailed information.",
