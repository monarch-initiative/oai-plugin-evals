    "agent_answer": "I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time medical databases or provide specific medical advice. However, I can tell you that sensorineural deafness with mild renal dysfunction could potentially be related to certain genetic conditions. For example, Alport Syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. It's caused by mutations in the COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes. \n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional or a genetic counselor for more accurate information. They can provide a comprehensive genetic testing and guide you through the interpretation of the results.",
