    "agent_answer": "I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have direct access to a database of gene symbols. However, you can usually find this information in a genetic database or scientific literature. The official gene symbol is typically a short form used by scientists to refer to a specific gene. For example, the gene symbol for the human gene often referred to as \"PCH3\" is TRIP13, which stands for \"Thyroid Hormone Receptor Interactor 13\". Please verify this information from a reliable source.",
