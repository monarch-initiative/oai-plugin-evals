    "agent_answer": "Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by catalyzing the dismutation of the superoxide radical (O2\u2212) into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. There are several types of SOD enzymes, each encoded by different genes in humans:\n\n1. **SOD1 (Superoxide Dismutase 1, Soluble)**: This gene encodes a cytoplasmic enzyme that is also found in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Mutations in the SOD1 gene are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\n2. **SOD2 (Superoxide Dismutase 2, Mitochondrial)**: The SOD2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme, which is responsible for the dismutation of superoxide radicals in the mitochondria. It is also known as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD).\n\n3. **SOD3 (Superoxide Dismutase 3, Extracellular)**: This gene encodes the extracellular form of the enzyme, which is found in the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces. It is also known as extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD).\n\nThese genes are critical for maintaining cellular health by mitigating the effects of oxidative stress, which can lead to cell damage and contribute to the development of various diseases. The SOD enzymes use metal ions such as copper, zinc, or manganese as cofactors to facilitate the dismutation reaction.",
