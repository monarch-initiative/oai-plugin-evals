    "agent_answer": "Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome (SCT) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the fusion of certain bones in the spine, wrist, and ankle. The exact genes related to SCT are not well understood, but mutations in the FLNB gene have been associated with this condition. The FLNB gene provides instructions for making a protein called filamin B, which is involved in the development and maintenance of the skeleton. Mutations in the FLNB gene can disrupt normal bone development, leading to the features of SCT. However, it is important to note that not all individuals with SCT have mutations in the FLNB gene, suggesting that other genes may also be involved in the development of this condition.",
