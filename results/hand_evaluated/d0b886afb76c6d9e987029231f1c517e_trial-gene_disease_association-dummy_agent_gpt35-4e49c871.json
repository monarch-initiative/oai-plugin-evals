    "agent_answer": "Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) is a condition that affects the discs between the vertebrae in the spine. It can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While there is no single gene that is solely responsible for IVDD, several genes have been found to be associated with an increased risk of developing the condition. These genes include:\n\n1. COL9A2: This gene encodes a protein called collagen type IX alpha 2 chain, which is a component of the intervertebral disc. Variations in the COL9A2 gene have been linked to an increased risk of IVDD.\n\n2. COL9A3: Similar to COL9A2, variations in the COL9A3 gene, which encodes collagen type IX alpha 3 chain, have also been associated with an increased risk of IVDD.\n\n3. COL11A1: This gene encodes collagen type XI alpha 1 chain, another component of the intervertebral disc. Variations in the COL11A1 gene have been found to be associated with an increased risk of IVDD.\n\n4. MMP3: The MMP3 gene encodes an enzyme called matrix metalloproteinase 3, which is involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components, including those in the intervertebral disc. Variations in the MMP3 gene have been linked to an increased risk of IVDD.\n\n5. ADAMTS5: This gene encodes a protein called ADAMTS5, which is involved in the breakdown of aggrecan, a major component of the intervertebral disc. Variations in the ADAMTS5 gene have been associated with an increased risk of IVDD.\n\nIt's important to note that having variations in these genes does not guarantee the development of IVDD. Genetic factors interact with environmental factors, such as lifestyle and physical activity, to contribute to the risk of developing the condition. Additionally, other genes and genetic factors may also play a role in IVDD, and further research is needed to fully understand the genetic basis of the disease.",
