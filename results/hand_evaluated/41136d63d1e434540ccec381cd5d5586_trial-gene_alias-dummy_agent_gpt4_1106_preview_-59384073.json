    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for RBAP1 is actually a mistake; it seems you might be referring to a gene commonly known by a similar acronym. The correct gene symbol for the protein that is often referred to as \"RbAp48\" or \"RbAp46\" is RBBP4. This gene encodes the Retinoblastoma Binding Protein 4. It's important to use the correct gene symbols when searching for information to avoid confusion, as gene nomenclature is standardized to ensure clear communication among researchers and clinicians.",
