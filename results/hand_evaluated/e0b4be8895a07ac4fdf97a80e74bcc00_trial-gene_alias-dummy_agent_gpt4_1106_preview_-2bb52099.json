    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol \"LEP9\" does not correspond to a known gene in human genetics. It's possible that there might be a typo or a misunderstanding regarding the gene symbol you're referring to.\n\nThe gene symbol \"LEP\" stands for leptin, which is a hormone predominantly made by adipose cells and enterocytes in the small intestine that helps to regulate energy balance by inhibiting hunger, which in turn diminishes fat storage in adipocytes. There is no numerical designation like \"9\" associated with the leptin gene in standard nomenclature.\n\nIf you are looking for information on a specific gene or if \"LEP9\" refers to something specific in a different context or organism, please provide additional details so I can assist you more accurately.",
