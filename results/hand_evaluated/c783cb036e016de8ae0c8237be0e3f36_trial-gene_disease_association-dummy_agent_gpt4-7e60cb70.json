    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Hyperphenylalaninemia is a condition that affects how phenylalanine is metabolized in the body. It's often caused by mutations in the PAH gene. This gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for the first step in processing phenylalanine. Mutations in the PAH gene disrupt the function of the enzyme, preventing the normal breakdown of phenylalanine. As a result, this amino acid can build up in the blood and other tissues, leading to the signs and symptoms of hyperphenylalaninemia. \n\nIn some cases, hyperphenylalaninemia can be caused by deficiencies in the enzymes that regenerate tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a molecule that helps process phenylalanine. These cases are caused by mutations in the GCH1, PCBD1, PTS, or QDPR genes.\n\nPlease consult with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor for more detailed information.",
