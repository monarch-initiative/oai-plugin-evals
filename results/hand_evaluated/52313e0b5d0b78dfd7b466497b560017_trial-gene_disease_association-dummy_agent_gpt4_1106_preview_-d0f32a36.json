    "agent_answer": "Neurodevelopmental disorders with gait disturbance can be caused by a variety of genetic factors. The specific genes involved can vary widely depending on the particular disorder. However, some genes have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders that may include gait disturbances as a symptom. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **SCN1A**: Mutations in this gene are often associated with Dravet syndrome, which can include gait disturbances among its symptoms.\n\n2. **MECP2**: Mutations in this gene are linked to Rett syndrome, which can lead to problems with gait and coordination.\n\n3. **FMR1**: Fragile X syndrome, which can cause intellectual disability and affect movement, is related to mutations in this gene.\n\n4. **DMD**: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leads to muscle degeneration and weakness, which can result in gait abnormalities.\n\n5. **GNAO1**: Mutations in this gene can lead to a variety of movement disorders, including those affecting gait.\n\n6. **ADGRG1**: This gene, also known as GPR56, has been associated with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, which can include gait disturbance as a symptom.\n\n7. **KMT2A**: Mutations in this gene can lead to Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome, which includes developmental delay and may affect motor function.\n\n8. **TSC1/TSC2**: These genes are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, which can include a range of symptoms, including movement disorders and gait disturbances.\n\n9. **ANKRD11**: Mutations in this gene can cause KBG syndrome, which may include developmental delay and issues with coordination and gait.\n\n10. **SLC6A1**: Mutations in this gene have been linked to a spectrum of neurological disorders, some of which may involve gait abnormalities.\n\nIt's important to note that neurodevelopmental disorders are often complex, with many potential genetic and environmental factors contributing to their manifestation. Additionally, gait disturbances can be a secondary effect of other primary symptoms, such as muscle weakness or neurological impairment. Genetic testing and consultation with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor can help determine the specific genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders in individual cases.",
