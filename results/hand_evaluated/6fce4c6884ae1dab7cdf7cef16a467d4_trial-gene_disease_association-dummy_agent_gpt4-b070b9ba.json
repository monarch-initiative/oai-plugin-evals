    "agent_answer": "Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome is a genetic condition that is associated with the LEMD3 gene. Mutations in this gene are known to cause this syndrome. The LEMD3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the outer membrane of the cell's nucleus. This protein plays a crucial role in bone development and growth.",
