    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for LSDMCA2 is \"LSD2.\" It stands for \"lysine-specific demethylase 2,\" and it is also known as \"KDM1B\" (lysine demethylase 1B). This gene encodes an enzyme that is involved in the demethylation of lysine residues on histone proteins, which is a key process in the regulation of gene expression.",
