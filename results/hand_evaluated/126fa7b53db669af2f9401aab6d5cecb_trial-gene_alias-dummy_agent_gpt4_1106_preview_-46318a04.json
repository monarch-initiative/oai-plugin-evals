    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for ZNF482 is indeed \"ZNF482.\" This stands for \"Zinc Finger Protein 482.\" It is a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains that can bind to DNA and potentially play roles in DNA recognition, RNA packaging, transcriptional activation, regulation of apoptosis, protein folding and assembly, and lipid binding.\n\nGene symbols are standardized by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) to ensure that each gene is uniquely and consistently named across the scientific community. The gene symbol \"ZNF482\" is the unique identifier for this particular zinc finger protein gene.",
