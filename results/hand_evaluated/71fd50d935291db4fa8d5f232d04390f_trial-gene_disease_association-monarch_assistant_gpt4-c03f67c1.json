    "agent_answer": "The genes related to the disease \"arteriovenous malformations of the brain\" (also known as \"Intracranial hemorrhage in brain cerebrovascular malformations\") are:\n\n1. [KRAS](https://monarchinitiative.org/gene/HGNC:6407): This gene has a causal relationship with the disease. The KRAS gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of important signaling pathways, called RAS/MAPK pathways, in cells. When activated, the KRAS protein, along with other proteins in these pathways, stimulates cell division and helps cells survive.\n\n2. [IL6](https://monarchinitiative.org/gene/HGNC:6018): This gene is correlated with the disease. The IL6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called interleukin 6, which stimulates the immune response to injury or infection.\n\nPlease note that while these genes are associated with the disease, it does not necessarily mean that variations in these genes cause the disease. The relationship can be complex and influenced by many factors.",
