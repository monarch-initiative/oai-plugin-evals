    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for \"TFA\" is not clear because \"TFA\" could be an abbreviation for different genes or proteins depending on the context. However, one common association with TFA in the context of genetics and molecular biology is \"TFAM,\" which stands for \"Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial.\" TFAM is a nuclear gene that encodes a protein responsible for the transcription and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA.\n\nIf you are referring to a different \"TFA\" or if you need information on a specific gene or protein, please provide more context or clarify the organism of interest, and I can attempt to provide a more accurate answer.",
