    "goldstandard": "PLK5",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for PLK-5 is not recognized in the standard nomenclature used by databases such as GeneCards, NCBI Gene, or HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee). This is because PLK-5 is not a standard designation for a gene in the Polo-like kinase family.\n\nThe Polo-like kinase (PLK) family in humans includes several members, typically numbered PLK1 through PLK4:\n\n- PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1) with the official gene symbol \"PLK1\"\n- PLK2 (Polo-like kinase 2) with the official gene symbol \"PLK2\"\n- PLK3 (Polo-like kinase 3) with the official gene symbol \"PLK3\"\n- PLK4 (Polo-like kinase 4) with the official gene symbol \"PLK4\"\n\nThere is no PLK5 in the standard human gene nomenclature. If you are referring to a gene from a different organism or a less commonly used nomenclature, please provide additional context so I can attempt to give you the correct information.",
