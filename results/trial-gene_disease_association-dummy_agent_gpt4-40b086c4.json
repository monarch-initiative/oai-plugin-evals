    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to provide real-time medical or genetic information. However, I can tell you that Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ic is a rare disorder that is often associated with mutations in the GNAS gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the activity of many other genes. Mutations in the GNAS gene can disrupt this regulation, leading to the signs and symptoms of Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ic. For more detailed and accurate information, please consult a medical professional or a geneticist.",
