    "agent_answer": "Vascular malformations are abnormalities in the blood vessels, and they can be associated with various genes depending on the type of malformation. Some of the genetic conditions that can lead to vascular malformations include:\n\n1. **Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT)** - This condition is also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome and is characterized by the development of abnormal blood vessels. It is associated with mutations in several genes, including:\n   - **ENG** (Endoglin)\n   - **ACVRL1** (Activin A receptor type II-like 1), also known as **ALK1**\n   - **SMAD4** (Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4)\n\n2. **Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM)** - These are vascular malformations that occur in the brain and are linked to mutations in the following genes:\n   - **CCM1/KRIT1** (Krev interaction trapped 1)\n   - **CCM2/MGC4607** (Malcavernin)\n   - **CCM3/PDCD10** (Programmed cell death 10)\n\n3. **Sturge-Weber Syndrome** - This is a rare congenital neurological and skin disorder. It is associated with somatic mutations in the **GNAQ** gene.\n\n4. **Capillary Malformation-Arteriovenous Malformation (CM-AVM)** - This condition is characterized by capillary malformations and arteriovenous malformations. It is associated with mutations in the **RASA1** gene (RAS p21 protein activator 1) and sometimes in the **EPCAM** gene.\n\n5. **Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS)** - This syndrome is characterized by port-wine stains, varicose veins, and bone and soft tissue hypertrophy. It has been associated with the **PIK3CA** gene.\n\n6. **Parkes Weber Syndrome** - This is a rare congenital vascular disorder that can be similar to KTS but includes arteriovenous fistulas. It may also be associated with mutations in the **RASA1** gene or the **EPCAM** gene.\n\n7. **Glomuvenous Malformations (GVMs)** - These are venous malformations that can be caused by mutations in the **GLMN** gene (Glomulin).\n\nIt's important to note that not all vascular malformations are hereditary; some may occur sporadically without a clear genetic cause. Additionally, the presence of a mutation in one of these genes does not guarantee that a person will develop a vascular malformation, as other genetic and environmental factors may also play a role. Genetic testing and counseling can help determine the risk and presence of these conditions in individuals and families.",
