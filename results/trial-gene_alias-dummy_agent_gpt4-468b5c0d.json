    "agent_answer": "I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. MPS4B is not recognized as an official gene symbol. The MPS (Mucopolysaccharidosis) series includes MPS I, II, III, IV, VI, and VII, but there's no MPS4B. MPS IV, also known as Morquio syndrome, has two subtypes: MPS IVA caused by mutations in the GALNS gene and MPS IVB caused by mutations in the GLB1 gene. Please verify the gene symbol or provide more details.",
