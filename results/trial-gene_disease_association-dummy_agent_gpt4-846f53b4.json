    "agent_answer": "As an AI, I can provide some information on this topic. Several genes are associated with the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus. These include:\n\n1. **TCF7L2 (Transcription Factor 7 Like 2)**: Variations in this gene are considered to have the strongest link to type 2 diabetes risk. It plays a role in the regulation of blood sugar levels by affecting the production and functioning of insulin.\n\n2. **PPARG (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma)**: This gene is involved in the regulation of fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism. Variations in this gene can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\n3. **KCNJ11 (Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily J Member 11)**: This gene helps regulate insulin production in the pancreas. Variations in this gene can affect the body's insulin production, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\n4. **ABCC8 (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 8)**: This gene is involved in the regulation of insulin, and mutations can lead to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\n5. **SLC30A8 (Solute Carrier Family 30 Member 8)**: This gene is involved in the process of insulin secretion, and variations can affect the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\n6. **GCK (Glucokinase)**: This gene helps regulate insulin secretion and variations can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\n7. **IRS1 (Insulin Receptor Substrate 1)**: This gene plays a role in insulin signaling, and variations can affect the body's response to insulin.\n\nPlease note that while these genes are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, they are not the sole cause. Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, and weight also play a significant role in the development of this disease. It's also important to note that not everyone with these gene variations will develop type 2 diabetes. Genetics is just one piece of the puzzle.",
