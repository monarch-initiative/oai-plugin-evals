    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol you provided, \"NEDCHS,\" does not match any known gene symbols in standard genomic databases such as NCBI Gene, HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee), or Ensembl. It's possible that there might be a typo or an alternative name for the gene you're referring to.\n\nGene symbols are standardized to avoid confusion and ensure consistent communication among researchers. If you have an alternative name or a more specific context for the gene you're interested in, please provide that information, and I can attempt to assist you further.",
