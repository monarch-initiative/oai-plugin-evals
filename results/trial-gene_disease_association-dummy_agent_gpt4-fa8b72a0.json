However, I can tell you that genetic disorders are often caused by mutations in specific genes. For Gastrointestinal defects and immunodeficiency syndrome, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional or a geneticist who can provide accurate and up-to-date information. They may use resources like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the Human Genome Project to find this information.",
