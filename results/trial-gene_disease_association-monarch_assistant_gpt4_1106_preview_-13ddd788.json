    "agent_answer": "It appears that there are no specific gene associations listed for liver failure (MONDO:0100192) in the Monarch Initiative knowledge graph at this time. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including the complexity of the disease, the current state of research, or the way the data is curated within the knowledge graph.\n\nLiver failure is a liver disease characterized by the liver losing or having lost all of its function. It can be a complex condition with multiple potential causes, including genetic factors, but the specific gene associations may not be well-defined or may not have been fully characterized in the context of the Monarch Initiative's data.\n\nFor more information on liver failure, you can visit the [Monarch Initiative's page on liver failure](https://monarchinitiative.org/disease/MONDO:0100192).",
