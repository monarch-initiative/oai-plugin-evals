    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for 15-Lipoxygenase (15-LOX) is ALOX15. This gene encodes for the enzyme arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, which is involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids to bioactive lipids. ALOX15 is part of the lipoxygenase family and plays a role in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and lipoxins, which are important in the inflammatory response and other physiological processes.",
