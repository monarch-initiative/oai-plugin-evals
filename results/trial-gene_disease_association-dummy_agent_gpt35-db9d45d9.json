    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT35",
    "agent_answer": "There are several genes that have been found to be related to B-cell immunodeficiency. Some of these genes include:\n\n1. CD19: Mutations in the CD19 gene can lead to a deficiency in B-cell development and function, resulting in immunodeficiency.\n\n2. CD20: Mutations in the CD20 gene can also cause B-cell immunodeficiency, as CD20 is involved in B-cell activation and differentiation.\n\n3. CD21: Defects in the CD21 gene can lead to a deficiency in B-cell function and impaired immune response.\n\n4. CD81: Mutations in the CD81 gene can result in B-cell immunodeficiency, as CD81 is involved in B-cell activation and signaling.\n\n5. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK): Mutations in the BTK gene can cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a lack of mature B cells and low levels of immunoglobulins.\n\n6. IgA deficiency: IgA deficiency is a common immunodeficiency disorder that can be caused by various genetic factors, including mutations in genes involved in IgA production and regulation.\n\nIt's important to note that B-cell immunodeficiency can have various genetic causes, and the specific genes involved may vary depending on the individual and the type of immunodeficiency disorder. Genetic testing and consultation with a healthcare professional or geneticist are recommended for a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis.",
