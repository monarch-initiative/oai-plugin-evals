    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for what is commonly referred to as PCH3 (Polycystic homolog 3) is not standardized as \"PCH3\" in human gene nomenclature. The term \"PCH3\" might be used colloquially or in certain research contexts to refer to a specific gene related to a polycystic condition, but it is not a recognized official gene symbol by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), which is responsible for approving unique symbols and names for human genes.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, it would be necessary to know the full name or the context in which \"PCH3\" is being used. There are several genes associated with polycystic diseases, such as PKD1 and PKD2, which are related to polycystic kidney disease. If you can provide more context or the full name of the gene you are referring to, I may be able to give you the correct official gene symbol.",
