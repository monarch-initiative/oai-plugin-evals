    "agent_answer": "Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome (BOS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin lesions known as connective tissue nevi and bone lesions called osteopoikilosis. The condition is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that only one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.\n\nThe gene most commonly associated with Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome is LEMD3 (also known as MAN1). Mutations in the LEMD3 gene are responsible for the majority of cases of BOS. The LEMD3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the regulation of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway, which plays a role in the development and maintenance of the skin and bones.\n\nIt's important to note that not all cases of Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome are caused by mutations in the LEMD3 gene. In some cases, the genetic cause of the disorder may not be identified, suggesting that there may be other genes involved that have not yet been discovered or that environmental factors may contribute to the condition in some individuals. Genetic testing and counseling can help to determine the specific cause of BOS in an affected individual and provide information about the inheritance pattern and risks to other family members.",
