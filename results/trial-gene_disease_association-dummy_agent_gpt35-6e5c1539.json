    "agent_answer": "I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific gene information related to Nephropathy due to CFHR5 deficiency. However, I can provide you with some general information about CFHR5 and its association with nephropathy.\n\nCFHR5 (Complement Factor H-Related 5) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the complement system, which is part of the immune system. Mutations in the CFHR5 gene have been associated with a rare kidney disorder called Nephropathy due to CFHR5 deficiency or CFHR5 nephropathy.\n\nIn individuals with CFHR5 nephropathy, the CFHR5 protein is either absent or present in reduced amounts. This can lead to uncontrolled activation of the complement system in the kidneys, causing inflammation and damage to the kidney tissue. The exact mechanism by which CFHR5 deficiency leads to nephropathy is not fully understood.\n\nIt's important to note that CFHR5 nephropathy is a rare condition, and genetic testing is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. If you suspect that you or someone you know may have CFHR5 nephropathy, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or a geneticist for further evaluation and guidance.",
