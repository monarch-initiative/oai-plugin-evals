    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for LMP10 is PSMB8. This gene encodes a component of the immunoproteasome, which is a variant form of the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds. The immunoproteasome plays a crucial role in the immune system by generating peptides for presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are important for the immune response to pathogens. PSMB8 specifically encodes the beta 5i subunit of the immunoproteasome, which is also known as LMP10 (low molecular mass polypeptide 10).",
