    "agent_answer": "Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) is a condition that affects the cushioning discs between the vertebrae of the spine. It is particularly common in certain dog breeds, but it can also occur in humans. The condition can lead to pain, nerve damage, and even paralysis. The genetic factors contributing to IVDD can vary between species and among individuals, but some genes have been associated with an increased risk of developing the condition.\n\nIn humans, genetic factors that may contribute to the development of intervertebral disc disease include:\n\n1. **COL9A2 and COL9A3**: These genes encode components of type IX collagen, which is part of the structure of intervertebral discs. Mutations in these genes have been associated with early-onset disc degeneration.\n\n2. **THBS2**: The thrombospondin 2 gene is involved in the synthesis of a protein that affects the extracellular matrix of the disc.\n\n3. **AGC1 (ACAN)**: The aggrecan gene is important for the structure of cartilage, including that found in intervertebral discs.\n\n4. **MMP3**: The matrix metallopeptidase 3 gene is involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components, and certain variants have been linked to disc degeneration.\n\n5. **CHST3**: This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the modification of cartilage components, and mutations can lead to skeletal disorders that may include disc disease.\n\n6. **ASP (ASPN)**: Asporin is a protein that interacts with aggrecan and has been implicated in disc degeneration.\n\n7. **GDF5**: The growth differentiation factor 5 gene is involved in the development of bone and joint structures, and variations in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to disc degeneration.\n\nIn dogs, particularly in breeds like Dachshunds, Beagles, and Shih Tzus, which are prone to IVDD, the genetic factors may be different. For example, a mutation in the FGF4 gene on chromosome 12 has been identified as a risk factor for chondrodystrophic breeds, which are breeds with characteristic short limbs and an increased risk of IVDD.\n\nIt's important to note that while these genes have been associated with an increased risk of IVDD, the condition is likely to be polygenic, meaning that multiple genes contribute to the risk, and environmental factors such as age, weight, and physical activity also play significant roles in the development of the disease. Genetic research is ongoing, and our understanding of the genetic basis of IVDD continues to evolve.",
