    "agent_answer": "I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have direct access to a database of gene symbols. However, TSH2B doesn't appear to be a standard gene symbol according to the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) guidelines. It's possible that TSH2B is a variant or alias of a gene, or it might be a typo. I recommend checking a reliable source such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the HGNC for the correct gene symbol.",
