    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Acrocallosal syndrome is primarily associated with mutations in the KIF7 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group of proteins called kinesins. Kinesins transport other proteins and cellular materials within cells, particularly nerve cells. The KIF7 protein is involved in the formation and function of the primary cilium, a small projection on the surface of cells that is involved in signaling pathways that control cell growth and division. Mutations in the KIF7 gene disrupt the normal function of the protein, leading to the abnormalities seen in Acrocallosal syndrome.",
