    "agent_answer": "I'm sorry, but there are currently no known gene associations for liver failure in the Monarch Initiative database. This doesn't mean that there are no genes related to liver failure, but rather that the database may not have that information at this time. Please note that our understanding of genetic associations with diseases is constantly evolving with ongoing research.",
