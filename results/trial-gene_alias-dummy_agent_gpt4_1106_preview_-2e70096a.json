    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for CTTNBP1 is \"CTTNBP2NL\". It stands for \"Cortactin Binding Protein 2 N-Terminal Like\". This gene is known to encode a protein that may be involved in synaptic function. The gene symbol can sometimes be updated or changed by official databases like the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), so it's always a good idea to check the latest information from reliable genomic databases or resources.",
