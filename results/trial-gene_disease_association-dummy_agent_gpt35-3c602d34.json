    "agent_answer": "Congenital disorder of deglycosylation (CDDG) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired protein glycosylation, which leads to a wide range of symptoms including developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and skeletal abnormalities. The specific genes associated with CDDG are:\n\n1. NGLY1: Mutations in the NGLY1 gene are the most common cause of CDDG. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called N-glycanase 1, which is involved in the breakdown and recycling of proteins in cells.\n\n2. DDOST: Mutations in the DDOST gene can also cause CDDG. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit (DDOST), which is involved in the process of protein glycosylation.\n\n3. MAGT1: Mutations in the MAGT1 gene have been found in a small number of individuals with CDDG. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called magnesium transporter 1, which is involved in the transport of magnesium ions across cell membranes.\n\nIt's important to note that these are not the only genes associated with CDDG, and there may be other genes that have not yet been identified. Genetic testing is typically required to confirm a diagnosis of CDDG and identify the specific gene mutations involved.",
