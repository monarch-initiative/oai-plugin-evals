    "goldstandard": "RNF7",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for CKBBP1 is \"Ckb\". This gene encodes for the protein creatine kinase B-type, which is involved in energy metabolism in cells, particularly in the brain and muscle tissues. The \"BP1\" in \"CKBBP1\" typically stands for \"binding protein 1,\" indicating that the protein may interact with or bind to creatine kinase B-type. However, gene nomenclature can vary, and it's important to refer to authoritative databases like NCBI's Gene or the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for the most accurate and up-to-date information.",
