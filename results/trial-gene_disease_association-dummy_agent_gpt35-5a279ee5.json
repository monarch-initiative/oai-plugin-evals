    "agent_answer": "There are several genes that have been found to be related to vascular malformation. Some of these genes include:\n\n1. ENG (Endoglin): Mutations in the ENG gene are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a disorder characterized by abnormal blood vessel formation.\n\n2. ACVRL1 (Activin A receptor type II-like 1): Mutations in the ACVRL1 gene are also associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).\n\n3. KRIT1 (Krev interaction trapped 1): Mutations in the KRIT1 gene are associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), which are abnormal clusters of blood vessels in the brain.\n\n4. CCM2 (Cerebral cavernous malformations 2): Mutations in the CCM2 gene are also associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs).\n\n5. PDCD10 (Programmed cell death 10): Mutations in the PDCD10 gene are associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs).\n\n6. TEK (Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase): Mutations in the TEK gene are associated with hereditary venous malformations.\n\nIt's important to note that these genes are just a few examples, and there may be other genes that are also associated with vascular malformation. Additionally, the presence of a mutation in one of these genes does not guarantee the development of a vascular malformation, as other factors may also play a role.",
