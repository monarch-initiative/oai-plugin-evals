    "agent_answer": "Neurodevelopmental disorders with nonspecific brain abnormalities and with or without seizures can be caused by various genetic factors. The specific genes involved can vary widely depending on the exact condition. However, some genes that have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and may be related to brain abnormalities and seizures include:\n\n1. **SCN1A** - This gene encodes a sodium channel protein that is critical for the proper function of brain neurons. Mutations in SCN1A can lead to Dravet syndrome, which is characterized by severe epilepsy and developmental delays.\n\n2. **MECP2** - Mutations in the MECP2 gene can cause Rett syndrome, a disorder that leads to severe cognitive and physical regression after an initial period of normal development. Seizures are common in individuals with Rett syndrome.\n\n3. **CDKL5** - The CDKL5 gene is associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder that includes early-onset seizures and severe cognitive impairment.\n\n4. **STXBP1** - Mutations in the STXBP1 gene can lead to Ohtahara syndrome, an early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders with epilepsy.\n\n5. **TSC1/TSC2** - These genes are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, a condition that can cause benign tumors in the brain and other organs, as well as epilepsy and developmental delays.\n\n6. **FOXG1** - Mutations in the FOXG1 gene can cause a severe brain disorder known as congenital variant of Rett syndrome, which is characterized by developmental delays, microcephaly, and seizures.\n\n7. **ARX** - The ARX gene is linked to several forms of X-linked intellectual disability and epilepsy.\n\n8. **SLC6A1** - Mutations in this gene can lead to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.\n\n9. **CHD2** - The CHD2 gene has been associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and epilepsy.\n\n10. **SYNGAP1** - Mutations in SYNGAP1 can cause intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy.\n\nIt's important to note that neurodevelopmental disorders are often complex and can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic testing and consultation with a geneticist or neurologist can help determine the specific genetic causes of a neurodevelopmental disorder in an individual. Additionally, research is ongoing, and new genes and mutations are continually being discovered that contribute to the understanding of these disorders.",
