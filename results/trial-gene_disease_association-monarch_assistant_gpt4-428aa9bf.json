[ESR2](https://monarchinitiative.org/gene/HGNC:3468): This gene is correlated with the disease.\n3. [NTRK1](https://monarchinitiative.org/gene/HGNC:8031): This gene is correlated with the disease.\n\nPlease note that a causal relationship means that changes in the gene are known to cause the disease, while a correlation means that changes in the gene are often seen in individuals with the disease, but it's not clear if these changes are a cause or a result of the disease.",
