    "agent_answer": "The official gene symbol for human Cyclin A associated protein (hCAP) is not standardized as \"hCAP\" in the gene nomenclature. The term \"hCAP\" could refer to different proteins depending on the context, as it is not a unique identifier. For example, hCAP could refer to a protein that is associated with Cyclin A, such as a member of the Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family.\n\nTo provide an accurate answer, it would be necessary to have more specific information about the protein in question. If you are referring to a specific protein complex or a protein that interacts with Cyclin A, please provide additional details or the full name of the protein so that I can attempt to identify the correct gene symbol for you.",
