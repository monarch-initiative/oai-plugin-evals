    "agent_answer": "I'm sorry, as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time medical databases or provide medical advice. However, some genes that have been associated with B-cell immunodeficiency in scientific literature include BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase), CD19, CD20, and CD21. Mutations in these genes can lead to conditions such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency. Please consult a healthcare professional or a genetic counselor for more accurate information.",
