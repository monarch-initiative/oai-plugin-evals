    "agent_answer": "Currarino syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by a triad of symptoms including a sacral anomaly, anorectal malformation, and a presacral mass. This syndrome is associated with mutations in the MNX1 gene (also known as HLXB9). This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development of the spinal cord and the motor neurons, cells that control muscle contraction. Mutations in the MNX1 gene disrupt the normal development of the lower spine and rectum, leading to the features of Currarino syndrome.",
