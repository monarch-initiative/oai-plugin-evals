    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT35",
    "agent_answer": "Ablepharon-macrostomia syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence or severe underdevelopment of the eyelids (ablepharon) and a wide mouth (macrostomia). The exact genes related to this syndrome are not well-defined, but mutations in the TWIST2 gene have been associated with some cases of Ablepharon-macrostomia syndrome. TWIST2 is involved in the development of various tissues and organs during embryonic development. However, it is important to note that not all cases of Ablepharon-macrostomia syndrome are caused by mutations in the TWIST2 gene, suggesting that other genes or genetic factors may also be involved.",
