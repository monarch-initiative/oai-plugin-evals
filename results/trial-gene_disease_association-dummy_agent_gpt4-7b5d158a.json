    "goldstandard": "CTSC",
    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4",
    "agent_answer": "Haim-Munk syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It is primarily associated with mutations in the CTSC gene (Cathepsin C gene). This gene provides instructions for making a protein called cathepsin C, which plays a crucial role in the function of immune system cells (neutrophils) that play a role in inflammation and in fighting infection. Mutations in the CTSC gene reduce or eliminate the function of cathepsin C, which disrupts the normal function of neutrophils and leads to the various features of Haim-Munk syndrome.",
