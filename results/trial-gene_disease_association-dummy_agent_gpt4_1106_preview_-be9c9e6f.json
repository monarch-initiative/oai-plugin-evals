    "agent_answer": "Corneal fleck dystrophy, also known as Francois-Neetens speckled corneal dystrophy, is a rare genetic eye disorder characterized by the presence of small white or yellowish flecks scattered throughout the stroma of the cornea. These flecks are typically asymptomatic and do not affect vision, but they can be detected during an eye examination.\n\nThe genetic basis of corneal fleck dystrophy is not fully understood, and as of my knowledge cutoff date in April 2023, there may not be a specific gene that has been definitively linked to the condition. However, corneal dystrophies in general are often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that a mutation in just one copy of the responsible gene can cause the disorder.\n\nResearch into the genetic causes of various corneal dystrophies is ongoing, and it is possible that future studies may identify specific genes associated with corneal fleck dystrophy. If you are looking for the most current information on the genetics of this condition, it would be best to consult the latest scientific literature or a medical professional who specializes in genetic eye disorders.",
