    "agent_name": "Dummy Agent GPT4 (1106-preview)",
    "agent_answer": "The term \"BMSC-MCP\" does not correspond to a standard gene symbol in human genetics. BMSC typically stands for Bone Marrow Stromal Cells, and MCP can refer to Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein, which is a group of cytokines involved in immune cell recruitment. However, MCP is not a gene but rather a protein product of certain genes.\n\nIf you are referring to a specific gene related to bone marrow stromal cells or monocyte chemoattractant proteins, it would be helpful to have the full name or context to provide an accurate gene symbol. Gene symbols are standardized by organizations such as the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for human genes, and they provide unique identifiers for each known gene.\n\nIf you have more context or a different interpretation of \"BMSC-MCP,\" please provide additional details so I can assist you more effectively.",
