# oai-plugin-evals

Evaluations for the Monarch OpenAI Plugin/Monarch Assistant against benchmarks. Work in progress: set OPENAI_API_KEY in `.env`, and
run `make`. Currently only tests the disease -> gene association test from the GeneTuring benchmark, using an automated evaluation of agent answers provided by a `DiseaseGenesEvalAgent`.
